# Getting Started with BRIAPI_collection copy

## Introduction

Postman collection for BRIAPI

## Building

### Requirements

The SDK relies on **Node.js** and **npm** (to resolve dependencies). It also requires **Typescript version 3.9+**. You can download and install Node.js and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> **NOTE:** npm is installed by default when Node.js is installed.

### Verify Successful Installation

Run the following commands in the command prompt or shell of your choice to check if Node.js and npm are successfully installed:

* Node.js: `node --version`

* npm: `npm --version`

### Install Dependencies

- To resolve all dependencies, go to the **SDK root directory** and run the following command with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

- This will install all dependencies in the **node_modules** folder.

## Installation

The following section explains how to use the generated library in a new project.

### 1. Initialize the Node Project

- Open an IDE/text editor for JavaScript like Visual Studio Code. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

- Click on **File** and select **Open Folder**. Select an empty folder of your project, the folder will become visible in the sidebar on the left.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?step=openProject)

- To initialize the Node project, click on **Terminal** and select **New Terminal**. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm init --y
```

### 2. Add Dependencies to the Client Library

- The created project manages its dependencies using its `package.json` file. In order to add a dependency on the *BRIAPI_collection copyLib* client library, double click on the `package.json` file in the bar on the left and add the dependency to the package in it.

- To install the package in the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `environment` | Environment | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.Production`** |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout for API calls.<br>*Default*: `0` |
| `httpClientOptions` | `Partial<HttpClientOptions>` | Stable configurable http client options. |
| `unstableHttpClientOptions` | `any` | Unstable configurable http client options. |
| `oAuthClientId` | `string` | OAuth 2 Client ID |
| `oAuthRedirectUri` | `string` | OAuth 2 Redirection endpoint or Callback Uri |
| `oAuthToken` | `OAuthToken` | Object for storing information about the OAuth token |

### HttpClientOptions

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout in milliseconds. |
| `httpAgent` | `any` | Custom http agent to be used when performing http requests. |
| `httpsAgent` | `any` | Custom https agent to be used when performing http requests. |
| `retryConfig` | `Partial<RetryConfiguration>` | Configurations to retry requests. |

### RetryConfiguration

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `maxNumberOfRetries` | `number` | Maximum number of retries. <br> *Default*: `0` |
| `retryOnTimeout` | `boolean` | Whether to retry on request timeout. <br> *Default*: `true` |
| `retryInterval` | `number` | Interval before next retry. Used in calculation of wait time for next request in case of failure. <br> *Default*: `1` |
| `maximumRetryWaitTime` | `number` | Overall wait time for the requests getting retried. <br> *Default*: `0` |
| `backoffFactor` | `number` | Used in calculation of wait time for next request in case of failure. <br> *Default*: `2` |
| `httpStatusCodesToRetry` | `number[]` | Http status codes to retry against. <br> *Default*: `[408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]` |
| `httpMethodsToRetry` | `HttpMethod[]` | Http methods to retry against. <br> *Default*: `['GET', 'PUT']` |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```ts
const client = new Client({
  timeout: 0,
  environment: Environment.Production,
  oAuthClientId: 'OAuthClientId',
  oAuthRedirectUri: 'OAuthRedirectUri',
  oAuthToken: null,
});
```

## Authorization

This API uses `OAuth 2 Implicit Grant`.

## Implicit Grant

Your application must obtain user authorization before it can execute an endpoint call incase this SDK chooses to use *OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant* to obtain a user's consent to perform an API request on user's behalf. This authorization includes the following steps

This process requires the presence of a client-side JavaScript code on the redirect URI page to receive the *access token* after the consent step is completed.

### 1\. Obtain user consent

To obtain user's consent, you must redirect the user to the authorization page. The `buildAuthorizationUrl()` method creates the URL to the authorization page.

```ts
const authUrl = client.implicitAuthManager.buildAuthorizationUrl();
```

### 2\. Handle the OAuth server response

Once the user responds to the consent request, the OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application's access request by redirecting the user to the redirect URI specified set in `Configuration`.

The redirect URI will receive the *access token* as the `token` argument in the URL fragment.

```
https://example.com/oauth/callback#token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

The access token must be extracted by the client-side JavaScript code. The access token can be used to authorize any further endpoint calls by the JavaScript code.
